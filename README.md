<h2>Podcastr</h2>


<h6>Overview:</h6>

Podcastr was inspired to solve the problem of choosing what podcast to listen to. The app allows the user to select a category and based on the selected category, Podcastr will start playing podcasts continuously. The user can skip or like podcasts and Podcastr will keep track of the history: which podcasts where listened to and when, which podcasts where liked, and which podcasts where skipped. The user can change categories as often and anytime they like. Once a new category is selected, a new podcasts matching the selected category will start playing. Itâ€™s like Pandora, just for podcasts!
